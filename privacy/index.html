		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<section>
			<article>
				<p>Last Updated: 16 May 2018</p>
				<p>In this Privacy Policy, "we", "us" and "our" refers to SPACEGOAT Interactive Pty Ltd.</p>
				<p>Generally speaking, we receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. We use the
				information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, providing our services (e.g. graphic design,
				web design and development, eLearning design and development, etc, together “Services”), and communicating with you. We
				collect information so that we may provide you with those Services you have requested from us. Although a large portion of
				the data we collect from you may be considered to be Personal Data (data that is capable, in some manner, of identifying
				you), we work to ensure that we do not collect more data than is necessary to provide our Services to you, or that could
				help in ensuring we provide the best possible Service to you.</p>
				<p>This Privacy Policy provides you with the details on how we handle your data and describes the ways you can manage your data
				with us.</p>
				<p>We will not give, sell, rent, or lease any personally identifiable information you choose to give us by visiting the site,
				to any other company. Unless we have your permission, or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide
				on the site with SPACEGOAT Interactive employees and/or our business partners, where appropriate.</p>
				<p>You have the right to access the personal information that we have registered about you and to request that this information
				is corrected or deleted if it is inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant.</p>
				<h3>Why we collect information</h3>
				<p><strong>To improve our website:</strong></p>
				<p>As visitors come and go from our website, we collect information about how they interact with our site. We can’t tell who
				is visiting because the data we collect is not personally identifiable but we can see things like which links brought them
				to our site, the pages they visited while on our site and the type of device they used to access our site. We use that information
				to identify problem areas, like where visitors are getting stuck or losing interest so we can make them better.</p>
				<p>We use Google Analytics to collect and aggregate that data, so if you have a Google account, they may be able to identify
				you depending on your privacy settings, which you can check by signing into your Google account.</p>
				<p><strong>For ads and social media:</strong></p>
				<p>We use third party platforms (listed below) such as Facebook and Google to promote SPACEGOAT Interactive to their users. We’ve installed
				lines of their code on our website that allow them to generate reports for us about how effective our activity has been on
				their platforms in terms of attracting new clients to our business. We use the reports to eliminate wasteful ad spending
				and to help us decide what kind of content we should create.</p>
				<p>Whilst we are not able to identify you personally via this process, the platforms themselves may be able to. Due to public
				pressure and regulation, these platforms now provide you with more control over what they can and can’t do with your data.
				We encourage you to review your privacy settings if you have an account with any of the following platforms:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Google</li>
					<li>Facebook</li>
					<li>Instagram</li>
					<li>Pinterest</li>
					<li>Twitter</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>To promote our business services:</strong></p>
				<p>When you initiate contact with us, whether it’s by submitting a form online or by sending us an email, we have a legitimate
				interest in using the information you share with us to promote our business services to you.</p>
				<p>Having said that, we have no desire to be somewhere that we’re not welcome, so if you no longer wish to receive information
				about our services, simply email us at opt-out@spacegoat.com and we will stop reaching out to you directly.</p>
				<p><strong>To provide you with updates:</strong></p>
				<p>When you enter your email address on our website or send us an email enquiry, your email address is
				added to the SPACEGOAT Interactive mailing list hosted by MailChimp. The email address you share will be used by SPACEGOAT Interactive
				to provide you with updates in the form of links to new content, project news, special offers, or anything else that is new
				at SPACEGOAT Interactive. Don't worry, we will not bombard you with emails on a daily or weekly basis. We will only write if we have something important to share.</p>
				<p>If you no longer wish to receive updates from SPACEGOAT Interactive, you can opt out by emailing opt-out@spacegoat.com.</p>
				<p>We will publish any changes to this policy on our website to ensure you know how we use personal information.</p>
